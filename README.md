# Education-Embedding-AI-ML-GNN-

The object of the EduEmbed project is to generate embeddings for the Education
Domain using Knowledge Graph Models such that they can understand the
underlying semantics of how the triples are correlated with each other. Once this
has been done, the embeddings can be used for various education domain related
tasks. Such as, curriculum generation, course sequencing, difficulty analysis, etc.
To achieve this it is of utmost importance that the embeddings generated are very
much effective in understanding the context of the domain. For these are training
and analyzing various models such as TransE, HolE, and TransH and their
generated embeddings.

Knowledge Graph Embeddings:
KG represents diverse types of information in the form of different types of entities
connected via different types of relations. Information extracted from KGs in the
form of embeddings is used to improve search, recommend products, and infer
missing domain specific context. Popular KGE models are TransE, TransH, etc.
which define different score functions to learn entity and relation embeddings.
Input data for KGE is in the form of triplets (head, relation, tail).
